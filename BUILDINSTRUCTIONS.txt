Build Instructions for UCF Shopping App

Our project uses WampServer for its server and database manager.

Download WampServer here:

http://www.wampserver.com/en/

After installing WampServer, place the "www" folder in the installation(wamp) 
directory. It will overwrite the existing www folder. This folder contains all of the .php
and .css files for our project.

The .sql file contains the necessary database information for our site to
work. It needs to be imported into the WampServer.

Once WampServer is installed, start WampServer with wampmanager.exe in the
wamp directory.

The wampserver site gives instructions on putting the server online.

Open up a browser and type "localhost/phpmyadmin" in the URL bar. Alternatively, click on the
Wamp icon in the start bar, then click on "phpmyadmin" in the menu that appears.

In phpMyAdmin, on the top toolbar, there is a menu item that says "Import". Click this.

Import the 127_0_0_1.sql file, then the USERS.sql file. Order matters. Disregard the 
'Importing into database "database_name" ' line at the top. We override this in our .sql files.

The first file imports the databases, the second creates the database users needed to access 
information from our web page.

The project should now be set up and ready to run.

Go into a browser and type "localhost/shopapp" into the URL bar. The front page should appear.
